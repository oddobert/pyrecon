# pyrecon

# Primary use for this project is to reconcilate 100 000s of transactions within bank and accountiong to identify deviations.

# This project is simply to be able to process two (or more later) files to find the differences from an accounting point of view.
# The files will have multiple columns and the program will select some columns to be compared. 
#
# Future work is also to see if sums can be reconciled across the files.
